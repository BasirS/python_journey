# 🐍 Journey Into Python  

Welcome to my **Journey Into Python** repository! 🚀 This is where I document my path to Python proficiency by practicing various concepts, writing scripts, and refining my problem-solving skills.  

This repository is an evolving collection of Python exercises, notebooks, and standalone `.py` scripts—essentially, all the hands-on coding I’ve done to sharpen my understanding of the language. Unlike project-based learning, which I maintain separately, this space is dedicated solely to structured practice.  

## 📌 About This Repository  

I started learning Python in 2023 using multiple educational resources, ranging from **beginner-friendly courses** to more **in-depth programming materials**. This repository will continue to grow as I explore new topics and refine my skills, and it is structured to **track my progress** and **store practice code**.

## 🏆 Learning Resources & Experience  

My Python journey is built on **a variety of structured courses, MOOC programs, and self-directed practice**. Here are some of the key learning resources that have contributed to my growth:  

### 🔹 **Beginner & Foundation Courses**  
- **Datacamp’s Beginner Python Courses** – Helped me grasp the basics, including data types, loops, functions, and basic data manipulation.  
- **University of Michigan’s Python for Everybody (Py4E) (MOOC)** – Strengthened my understanding of Python fundamentals, working with files, databases, and web scraping.  
- **CIS 2300 (College Coursework)** – Introduced me to Python in an academic setting, covering structured programming and computational thinking.
- **CIS 3120 (College Coursework)** – Focused on data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming, improving my problem-solving skills and deepening my understanding of efficient programming techniques.

## 🚀 What’s Next?  

- 📌 **Continuing my learning journey** by exploring more Python concepts, algorithms, and best practices.  
- 📂 **Regularly updating** this repository with new notebooks and practice scripts.  
- 🎯 **Diving deeper** into Python frameworks, automation, and more advanced problem-solving techniques.
