    "Output shows that there were no earthquakes that occurred in February 2024 because no \"X\" appeared on the calendar. However, when running it again on December 2023 this time, there were multiple occurrences of earthquakes throughout that month as the \"X\" appeared everywhere except on a Saturday and a Sunday, 30th and 31st, respectively. Filtering data through the apply(lambda x:) for both year and month culminated such code to extract the year and month from the time column of merged_earthquakes dataset. To be honest, this was very intriguing for me."
