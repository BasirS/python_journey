# In-Class Practice and Coursework for Business Analytics (Python)

## Description

This repository serves as a record of my learning journey in Business Analytics using Python. It contains code snippets, exercises, and practice projects completed during various class sessions, along with datasets used for analysis.

## Repository Organization

### `practice`
This directory holds a collection of in-class practice code, including:
- Classwork exercises  
- SQLite practice code  
- Solutions to end-of-class coding exercises

### [`OOP_mini-group_8_project`](https://github.com/BasirS/OOP_mini_group_project)
This directory contains the code for a mini-project completed in a repository named **OOP_mini_group_project**.

### `more_OOP`(https://github.com/BasirS/More_OOP)
This directory contains code related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, forked from `sonylnagale/classes-example`.

### `eda`
This directory contains the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed for the paired mini-project. This involved:

*   Loading, inspecting, and cleaning the data using Pandas.
*   Univariate analysis (histograms, box plots, frequency tables).
*   Bivariate analysis (numerical vs. categorical).
*   Data transformations and aggregation.
*   Data filtering.

The EDA aimed to understand the dataset's characteristics, identify patterns, and interpret analysis results.

## Coursework Explored

Through these practice codes and projects, you'll find explorations of various aspects of Python programming relevant to Business Analytics, such as:
- Accessing and manipulating data from various sources (including SQLite)  
- Creating informative data visualizations  
- Writing functions to analyze data  
- Designing and implementing object-oriented solutions (using the **more_OOP** directory)  
- Debugging code to identify and fix errors  
- Organizing and commenting code for better readability

## Additional Notes

- Feel free to browse the code for reference or as a learning tool.  
- Some code snippets may be incomplete or represent exercises in progress.  
- The focus is on the practical application of concepts rather than polished production code.
